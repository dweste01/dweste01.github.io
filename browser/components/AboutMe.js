        <p className="aboutMe">
          I was born and raised in New Jersey, although I have lived in Boston since I began studying at Tufts University in 2011. I majored in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, which is an interdisciplinary degree mainly rooted in Psychology, but first introduced me to Computer Science. I loved the challenge of programming and decided to double major in Computer Science as well. At Tufts, I was a member of the varsity swim team, and had the opportunity to study abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark!

          Upon graduating in 2015 I worked as a QA Intern at The Debt Exchange in Boston, MA where I wrote user stories and executed test plans for newly-pushed code for their online loan-sales platform. DebtX follows Agile methodology, and I also got to participate in daily standups and biweekly retrospectives.

          In August 2015 I began working at Huron Consulting Group as an Oracle application analyst in their Enterprise Systems & Analytics (ES&A) practice. As an Oracle platinum partner, we implemented the Oracle suite of financial reporting applications for large enterprises; I personally specialized in implementing their masterdata management tool, DRM (Data Relationship Management). I was also responsible for writing solution documentation and leading knowledge-transfer and training sessions for admins and stakeholders.

          However, I wanted to move to a more technical role- I've always loved puzzles and logic problems, and I remember how much I was challenged by and enjoyed my CS classes in college. In March 2017 I left Huron to attend Fullstack Academy in NYC, which is an immersive web-development bootcamp where I learned end-to-end Javascript development.

          I'm super passionate about the entire technology stack, but particularly the front end. I love to challenge myself and stretch my limits, and am always hungry to learn more. I'm also a big beach bum, and I have a 13-year old dog named Chad. I've read the Harry Potter series 5 times, and I love cooking, crossword puzzles, and huge cups of coffee!
